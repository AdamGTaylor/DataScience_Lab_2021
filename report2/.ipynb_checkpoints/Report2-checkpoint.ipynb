This is a major step, due to its smaller size compared to the original data, and is proof about me fully understanding and correctly handling the dataset avaliable online. With this I can conclude that the data preprocssing and cleaning part of this project is finally done.\n",

While kooplex has the avaliable data in the correct format, I will try to do this conversion as it adds flexibility for my project (basicly indepence from kooplex). This conversion could be done with h4toh5, which programs main deal is to convert old NASA HDF4 file to HDF5. It is done like the following:\n",
